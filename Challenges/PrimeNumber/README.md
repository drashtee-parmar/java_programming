- Create a for statement using any range of numbers
- Determine if the number is a prime number using the isPrime method
- if it is a prime number, print it out AND increment a count of the
number of prime numbers found
- if that count is 3 exit the for loop
- hint:  Use the break; statement to exit
- NOTE: Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1. They only have two factors, 1 and the number itself. This means these numbers cannot be divided by any number other than 1 and the number itself without leaving a remainder.
